Data Types in JavaScript
Data types specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.
The data types are divided into into three main categories: 
Primitive – Are those which hold only one value at a time.
                   String, Number, and Boolean .
Composite – Are those types can hold collections of values and more complex 
                      Entities.
                     Object, Array, and Function.
Special -  Undefined and Null

The String Data Type
The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters, as shown below:
var a = “javascript”; 
The Number Data Type
The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation
var a = 210; 
var b = 84.5;
The Boolean Data Type
The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. as demonstrated below:
var isReading = true; 
var isSleeping = false;
.
	
The Undefined Data Type
The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.
var a;
var b = "Hy there"
 
alert(a)  // undefined
alert(b)  // Hy there

The Null Data Type
This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.
A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.
var a = null; 
alert(a);    //null

The Object Data Type
The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data. An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects. Down below car is object .
var car = { modal: "BMW X3", color: "white", doors: 5 }
The Array Data Type
An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].
var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];
The Function Data Type
The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables, as shown in the example below:
var greeting = function(){ return "Hello World!"; }
